## WebPage Details
This webpage is a fun personal project hosted by Github Pages for Technical Communications Class, and I am using an open source theme maintained by Matt Graham [link](https://github.com/mattgraham)


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/matthewliu2000/htmlwebpage/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
