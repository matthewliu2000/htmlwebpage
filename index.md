# Welcome to My Webpage!!!

A little about me! I am a **third year** undergraduate as a **Computer Engineering** major studying at **Georgia Institute of Technology**.
Full time student looking for a summer internship in 2020. I finish undergraduate studies in Spring 2021, and I plan to pursue a higher degree.  
Here is a [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-liu-315aa014b/) to my LinkedIn page.

## Website Information! <a name = "webpage"></a>
This webpage is a fun independent project created for Technical Communications Class (ECE3005).  
It is hosted and powered by Github Pages/Jekyll and the theme is by Matt Graham [github](https://github.com/mattgraham)  
I used Markdown which is a simple, light-weight syntax for styling writing   
You can fork/clone this project at my github repo [page](https://github.com/matthewliu2000/page)
