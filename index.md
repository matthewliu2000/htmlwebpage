# Welcome to My Webpage!!!

A little about me! I am a **third year** undergraduate as a **Computer Engineering** major studying at **Georgia Institute of Technology**.
Full time student looking for a summer internship in 2020. I finish undergraduate studies in Spring 2021, and I plan to pursue a higher degree.

## Website Information! <a name = "webpage"></a>
This webpage is a fun independent project created for Technical Communications Class (ECE3005).  
It is hosted and powered by Github Pages/Jekyll and the original theme is by [Matt Graham](https://github.com/mattgraham)  
I used Markdown which is a simple, light-weight syntax for styling writing   
You can fork/clone this project at my github [repository page](https://github.com/matthewliu2000/page)

## Quick Bio <a name = "aboutme"></a>
Third year Computer Engineer Student at Georgia Tech with industry experience in hardware engineering specializing in pre-silicon validation within an SoC. Adaptable, resourceful, and adept at working in focused and collaborative environments, debugging problems during testing, and creating or finding solutions. Successful in climate research and other multi-disciplinary internships. Actively looking for hardware design engineering internships and co-ops Spring and Summer 2020.  

My career goal is to immerse myself with comprehensive, interdisciplinary knowledge in computer engineering and computer science, and become well trained in integrating hardware and software, as well as application of engineering concepts and methods to computer systems engineering and design. I aim to achieve a masters or doctorate degree in ECE from which I hope to pursue work in research or industry.
